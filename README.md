I had few reasonris to write this project:
1. Something like guest book, because every developer should create it.
2. Is it possible to increase performance of Python application just with replacing it with Go?
And if yes, how painful it will be to write and how fast it may be.
3. Can we choose some exotic components in
our stack (S3-compatible server as comments storage) and achieve reasonable performance?
4. And also I need some golang experience

**Disclaimer:** it is not production-ready solution, it's mostly MVP.
